;;Thank you to my tutor David Holz: http://www.grindwork.com who has helped mold me into the competent 
;;programmer I am today. He has contributed alot of info to my project thus far and given me the courage to 
;;excel at it. When approaching something new, I think "What would David Holz do" and that consistently 
;;makes me a winner

;;Thanks to Arjun Comar for all his help and guidance on my project so far. https://github.com/arjuncomar
;;He's an amazing programmer and a great guy to work with. Amnther guy I steal my ideas from.

;;Thank you to Jay Bromley for writing CL-OPENCV https://github.com/ryepup/cl-opencv. The knowledge 
;;gained from that library helped get started writing this project.

;;Thank you to OpenCV, the best Computer Vision library in the world. I mold their documentation into 
;;my own, because why mess with perfection.

;;Thank you to all the folks at Stack Overflow, who made this alot easier, Baggers, Roerd, Marol, 
;;Joshua Taylor, berak, acelent, B...,Rainer Joswig, Xach, and much, much, more.

;;Thanks to byulparan from whose COMMON-CV project: https://github.com/byulparan/common-cv I borrowed 
;;some writing styles. It's a beautiful project

;;Thank you to Willem Rein Oudshoorn from CFFI-DEVEL who has made possible my inclusion of finalizers 
;;in this library. He has helped me to iron out a few bugs and has answered quite a few questions of 
;;mine. The knowledge I gained from those answers has really made this a much better library.
